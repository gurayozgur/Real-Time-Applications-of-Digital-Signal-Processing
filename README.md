# Real-Time Applications of Digital Signal Processing

## Course Description: 
This course teaches the theory and practice of signal processing on real world problems.
Particular emphasis is given to the practical applications and real-time processing in embedded systems. Students
will apply the Signal Processing theory in MATLAB and LabVIEW and hence this course will provide extensive
hands-on experience for real-time processing with embedded systems. The course aims to strengthen the student’s
understanding of the foundations of Digital Signal Processing. Students will get acquainted with the professional
hardware and software. This course allows students to gain knowledge and experience to implement complete
DSP projects and improve skills on embedded platforms through intense laboratory experiments. Interactive
teaching of the DSP applications and practical evaluation of the students' progress will improve students’
background continuously. Students are expected to gain important engineering skills by implementing signal
processing systems in MATLAB and real-time embedded hardware by writing efficient programs in LabVIEW
and C.
